Work in Progress: Parse Intel Relocatable Object Module Format (OMF) files for MS-DOS
=====================================================================================

Intel Relocatable Object Module Format (OMF) is used in MS-DOS by compilers,
assemblers, and linkers.

This is just some Python code I am playing around with to parse a OMF file.

It definitely does NOT work yet.

Documentation on the Relocatable Object Module Format (OMF) is in the document
"Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Portable Formats Specification Version 1.1"
located at: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/TIS1.1.pdf The later
version 1.2 removed documentation on OMF.
